# Africa Trip Itinerary

## Information on the Project
We collected a random list of latitutdes and longitutdes for 1,500 cities around the world, including their weather. Customers are able to filter choices for rainfall, snowfall, high and low temperatures for different cities. We then looked at what hotels were in the areas they selected in their filter.

## Outline
We created a pop up marker to show the cities on the map, and then choose 4 cities based on filtered options. After that, we built an itinerary showing the driveable route customers could take. After building the route, we layered this on to the map.
